Automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the customers of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a human clerk or bank teller. Using an ATM, customers can access their bank accounts in order to make cash  withdrawals and check their account balances. However, modern ATM also provides means of depositing to an account and pays some banking institution also allows customer to pay bills through the machine.


This machine problem would like to simulate the process of how an ATM provides financial transactions limited to checking of balance, withdrawing valid amount, and making deposit. Provide a menu similar to a regular ATM with proper directions for the customers to follow. Take into considerations the limitations of the different transactions that this program will provide. Make at least three different accounts.
